# Sup is building the fictional worlds of the future.
We experiment with blockchains and other new technologies, introducing novel mechanics on top of them to create entirely new kinds of settings, characters, stories, and experiences that are supported by our rapidly growing community.

Sup is an early-stage startup that is off to an incredible start. Although this role has a title, everyone at Sup wears more than one hat, and we'll be spending a lot of time figuring out what we do together — and how we do it. Ultimately, working at Sup means working with the best of the best, learning, growing, and paving the way for something entirely new.

Sup was co-founded by Dom Hofmann, the founder of Vine (as well as Blitmap and Loot, two of the most notable projects in our space), and Chris Supino, a veteran game producer and designer. We recently raised a $12M seed round led by Paradigm.

## About the role

We're looking for a designer who is interested in building polished, novel, fun interfaces that will serve as the digital surface for Sup’s many worlds and communities.

You'll primarily focus on UX/UI, but your visual design muscles should be strong. As a member of a small company and an even smaller design team, the scope of your influence will only be limited by your ambition. There are no icon designers, accessibility specialists, or design system managers here. For now, you’ll wear all of those hats and more.  Your days will be spent setting the bar for product design at Sup, from wireframing through iteration to launch. Together we’ll create a holistic vision for the future of the entire Sup universe.

## What we're looking for

- 4+ years of experience as a product designer with fluency across web, mobile and gestural interaction design
- Meticulous attention to detail
- Experience building in-depth, communicative prototypes
- Strong understanding of design system best practices
- Proficiency in creating and managing Figma components and libraries
- Aptitude for collaborating with team members, partners, and vendors
- Comfort managing ambiguity, working autonomously, and multitasking
- Ability to explain your vision and inspire others, but also solicit and embrace feedback

## Major bonuses
- Strong graphic design skills—if you’re as comfortable typesetting a business card as you are fine-tuning the corner radius of a button component, this is probably the job for you.
- CSS, JavaScript, or React know-how
- Experience working on video games and/or social platforms

## Benefits and other details
- Competitive salary and significant equity
- Medical, dental, and vision insurance fully covered for you and your dependents
- Company holidays and unlimited vacation, plus gentle nudges to take that vacation
- No crunch culture
- NYC or remote
 
Sup is an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment for our team that supports our work and the community and customers we build for.
