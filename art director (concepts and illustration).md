# Sup is building the fictional worlds of the future.
We experiment with blockchains and other new technologies, introducing novel mechanics on top of them to create entirely new kinds of settings, characters, stories, and experiences that are supported by our rapidly growing community.

Sup is an early-stage startup that is off to an incredible start. Although this role has a title, everyone at Sup wears more than one hat, and we'll be spending a lot of time figuring out what we do together — and how we do it. Ultimately, working at Sup means working with the best of the best, learning, growing, and paving the way for something entirely new.

Sup was co-founded by Dom Hofmann, the founder of Vine (as well as Blitmap and Loot, two of the most notable projects in our space), and Chris Supino, a veteran game producer and designer. We recently raised a $12M seed round led by Paradigm.

## About the role

We're looking for an Art Director who is interested in developing new worlds, characters, and objects, working on everything from 2D art to toy production. You will be a key member of our creative team and work directly with the founders to lead the artistic direction of our world building efforts. 

You will set visual standards for new projects from conception through production to delivery — to create a holistic vision for the future of the entire Sup universe. 

Since we are a brand new company, there is an expectation in our early days that you will be directly responsible for concepts and illustration. As we scale, you will identify critical hires and partners to help build out a diverse art team. You’ll gather and take input from this team, but will be the one responsible for making decisions on the visual quality, style, and mood.

## What we're looking for

- **Please note that is not a design role. Strong experience as an illustrator or concept artist is required.**
- 5+ years of experience as an illustrator, art director, or similar creative roles
- 2+ years of experience leading teams from strategy through execution
- Strong understanding of concept-to-production pipelines and technical ability or experience, for example:
  - 2D art to animation pipeline for cartoon shows
  - 2D to 3D art pipeline for hard surface and organic objects for gaming or relevant media
- Experience providing creative direction for character and world design to an art team
- Strong background in creating IP with a strong community following 
- Work with other members of the creative team to develop strategies and style guides for partners and vendors
- Self motivated. Ability to manage ambiguity, work autonomously, and multitask
- Excellent ability to explain your creative vision and inspire others, but also solicit and listen to feedback
- Ability to develop and maintain a deep understanding of a growing number of characters, story worlds, and creative strategies. Act as the creative guide and authority for external product development teams.

## Major bonuses
- A wide array of creative interests, from fashion to furniture and toys to TV shows

## Benefits and other details
- Competitive salary and significant equity
- Medical, dental, and vision insurance fully covered for you and your dependents
- Company holidays and unlimited vacation, plus gentle nudges to take that vacation
- No crunch culture
- NYC or remote
 
Sup is an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment for our team that supports our work and the community and customers we build for.
